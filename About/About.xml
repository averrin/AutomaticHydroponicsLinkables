  <description>Automatic Hydroponics Linkables adds new powered facilities that link to Automatic Hydroponics and modify processing speed and yield. Effects are data-driven and shown directly in the processing UI and menus.

Features
- Fertilizer Injector: modest speed boost, low power, adjacent placement
- Hydroponic AI Optimizer: stronger speed boost, higher power, adjacent, 2x2
- Yield Overclocker: doubles yield while making processes ~1.5x slower
- Effective time and (if applicable) yield multiplier displayed in process list and options menu
- Data-driven tuning per facility via modExtensions
- Locked behind a single research after Fabrication + Hydroponics

New facilities
- Fertilizer Injector
  - Power: low
  - Placement: adjacent
  - Effect: small speed increase per linked injector (capped)
- Hydroponic AI Optimizer
  - Power: high; 2x2
  - Placement: adjacent; single link
  - Effect: notable speed increase
- Hydroponic Yield Overclocker
  - Power: moderate
  - Placement: adjacent; single link
  - Effect: 2x yield; ~1.5x slower processing

Research
- Automatic Hydroponics Enhancements (after Fabrication + Hydroponics)
  - Unlocks all three facilities

Requirements
- Automatic Hydroponics (parent mod)
- Vanilla Expanded Framework

Warning:
1. This mod uses ugly AI-generated sprites, because I cannot draw, like at all. If you have images that I can use here, please share.
2. This mod is in Beta and not tesxted enough.
3. It patches some VEF internals, so it can cause incompatibilities with other mods that use VEF PipeSystem/Processes.Automatic Hydroponics Linkables adds new powered facilities that link to Automatic Hydroponics and modify processing speed and yield.
